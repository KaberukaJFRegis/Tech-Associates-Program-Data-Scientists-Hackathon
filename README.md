# Public Transport Fare System Sentiment Analysis in Rwanda

## Overview

This project aims to analyze public sentiment regarding the recent shift to a distance-based fare pricing model in Rwanda's public transport system. By extracting, processing, and analyzing data from diverse sources such as social media, online forums, news comments, and potential survey data, this solution seeks to provide policymakers with actionable insights into citizen perceptions, key concerns, and potential misinformation surrounding the new fare system.

The goal is to deliver a dashboard, report, or visualizations that summarize sentiment trends over time and across different data sources, ultimately helping policymakers make informed decisions and address public concerns effectively.

## Code Structure

The `code/` directory contains the Python script (`sentiment_analysis.py`) responsible for performing the sentiment analysis and generating basic visualizations and recommendations.
